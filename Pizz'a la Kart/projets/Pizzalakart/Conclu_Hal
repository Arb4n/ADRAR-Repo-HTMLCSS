( We’ll end with a simple conclusion, which will be a simple summary of the last events in our little group. )
We started as this patched up group, on a blank page concerning every aspect of the project, but this vas really short timed. Indeed, the idea of a topic for a website about e-commerce, for its name, for its theme just popped out between us and appeared really organically. 
It is probably the prerogative of a small group, but we went partly on improv about our tasks and organization, and it worked out quite well for us. 
The project is on a good way, and the only thing needing to be done is to go on with the few tweaks and corrections still in the air, and go further in the next development projects. 
So Let’s go !!
